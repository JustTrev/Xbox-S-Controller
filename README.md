# Xbox-S-Controller
The Xbox OG Kit 


### **Xbox OG Kit**  
is a frontend user interface that allows users to customize their OG XBox controller inputs used with Xb2Input with included requirements in order to get it working properly on Windows 10, or 11.

The "Xbox OG Kit Installer" will unpack all of requirements necessary to run.  It's a custom built script output from the installers that are used for Xb2Input.

**To-Do:**
• Swap buttons with Remap Controller enabled.

• Run analog Driver Installer batch script in background to update the installer progressbar.

• Look into installing ViGEmBus silently or without human intervention completely.

• Update the background controller image to show the right connected controller, based on it's serial number. (such as racing wheel, or madcatz wireless controllers, etc.)

• Detect the Xbox Communicator and it's serial number for full headset support and Xbox Original style voice changer. (might need to make a sound device driver for this to happen much like the controllers).

• Add an Uninstaller for Xbox OG Kit to remove all of it's contents.

**Known Bugs:**

• Other controller accessories such as the headset communicator, might cause Xb2Input from being able to detect your controller. (Work around - Disconnect controller and remove accessories before reconnecting your controller into your PC. Let Xb2Input detect your controller first before plugging in any accessory into the controller.)
